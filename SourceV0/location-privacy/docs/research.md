Accio is a research project developed at the [LIRIS laboratory](https://liris.cnrs.fr) (Lyon, France).
It originated from the [Priva'Mov project](https://privamov.liris.cnrs.fr), whose purpose was to collect mobility data in order to study location privacy.
Accio is currently being used by the [DRIM team](https://liris.cnrs.fr/drim/) at the LIRIS and by the [SYSCO team](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/sysco/accueil-sysco.php) at the [GIPSA laboratory](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/) (Grenoble, France).

It is named after the spell *Accio* in the Harry Potter books, whose goal is to make a remote object fly towards the spell caster.
Our own Accio is a tool whose purpose is to execute a scientific workflow and get handy results in a timely and convenient manner.
