title: Accio overview

Accio is scientific workflow management framework.
It allows to easily define and run experiments, and provides tools to analyse these results.
Although it is designed as a generic tool for any scientific workflow, it has been successfully applied to study location privacy.

Accio comes with several elements: 

  * an API to implement operators;
  * a workflow and experiment description format;
  * an execution engine, scheduling and executing the experiment;
  * a command line application, used to launch experiments;
  * a web UI, allowing to track the execution progress of experiments.

We also provide a complete set of operators designed to study location privacy.
