## Running experiments

The `accio run` command is used to launch experiments.
It requires one or many arguments specifying paths to files containing experiment definitions.
These files must be JSON files formatted according to the [definition language](workflows.html).
You can specify files containing either a experiment definition or a workflow definition (which will be implicitly converted into an experiment).

### Experiment execution

Experiments are ran locally, in the same process, using all available cores of your machine.
It means that you must be careful to not interrupt the process until it completed.
If you specify several files, they will be launched sequentially.

### Options for `accio run`

`-workdir=/path/to/directory`

The working directory is the place where the reports generated by experiments will be stored.
By default, a temporary directory will be created and advertised in the console output, but you can specify a specific directory.
Outputs of several experiments can be stored in the same directory, names of files storing reports are generated in such a way to avoid name clashes.

`-name="My experiment name"`

Overrides the experiment name at runtime, when launching it.
It will replace the value specified in the definition file.

`-tags="tag1 tag2"`

Overrides the experiment tags at runtime, when launching it.
Tags are space-separated, heading or trailing whitespaces are ignored.
It will replace the value specified in the definition file.

`-notes="Some notes to remember why I ran this experiment"`

Overrides the experiment notes at runtime, when launching it.
It will replace the value specified in the definition file.

`-runs=3`

Overrides the experiment minimum number of runs at runtime, when launching it.
It will replace the value specified in the definition file.

`-user="John Doe <john.doe@gmail.com>"`

Specifies the user who ran the experiment.
It can include an email address between chevrons.
If this option is not specified, the person who launched an experiment is automatically recorded by using two sources:

  * The environment variable `ACCIO_USER`, which contains the user in the same allowed format.
  * The current shell user, in which case no email address can be inferred.

`-params="node1/epsilon=0.002 node2/distance=30.meters"`

Overrides some parameters at runtime, when launching the experiment.
Parameters are space-separated. Parameter names are references, written in the same manner than inside [workflow definitions](/definition-language.html).
It will take precedence over parameters defined inside a workflow, but execution strategies may still override them later (e.g., if this parameter is being optimized).


## Built-in documentation

Accio comes with built-in documentation.

  * `accio help` enumerates all available commands and their options.
  * `accio help <command>` provides detailed information about a given command.
  * `accio help list-ops` enumerates all available operators, their inputs and outputs.
  * `accio help <operator>` provides detailed information about a given operator.
